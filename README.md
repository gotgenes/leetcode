# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my attempts to solve [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems in the Go programming language.

None of these solutions are guaranteed to work, let alone get you hired.
Browse at your own risk; borrow at your own peril.

If you're a hiring manager, I recommend finding a more effective interview practice than screening with LeetCode questions.
For most organizations, it is unrepresentative of the work.
